ElectroProto is a prototyping and small-scale production system for electronics.
It aims to allow you to realize eletronics from a schematic in under 1 hour, with
minimal manual steps once the process is started.

ElectroProto aims to be cheap, small and safe/covenient enough that every hackerspace,
and engineering individual, can have one - next to their 3d printer.

Milestones
===========
0.0.1: Proof-of-concept. Can mill+drill a PCB without intermediate manual steps.
0.1.0: Minimally useful. Can mill+drill+paste a PCB ". Board cutout, component placement and reflow done manually.
0.2.0: Can mill+drill+cutout+paste a PCB ".
0.3.0: Can mill+drill+paste+pick-and-place a PCB ". Solder reflow done manually.
0.4.0: Can mill+drill+paste+pick-and-place+reflow a PCB ".
x.0.0: Electroproto is available for purchase from several manufacturers, and can be made using standard fablab tools.

TODO
======
0.0.1:
* Get a computer-controlled XY axis. Makerblock robot plotter kit?
* Get 2 Dremels or similar cheap multitools. Cotech, Clas Ohlson?
* Get or make 2 Z-axis with Dremel mounts. Multitool drill-press, Clas/Biltema? Alt: Reprap/thingiverse design
* Hack them to be computer-controlled. Servo-motor or stepper?
* Allow to input a set of Gerber files for the PCB traces and holes

0.1.0:
* Get a vacum-controlled solder dispenser. DealExtreme?
* Hack it to be computer controlled.
* Improve Gerber input to also dispense solder paste on the PCB
* Document the build for reproducability
