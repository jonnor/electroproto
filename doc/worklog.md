--------------------
Assembled the Makeblock.cc pen plotter kit,
rebuilt to become a more suitable X-Y axis for PCB production.
Did very simple movement and pen-testing to verify all pieces
working.

15 hours.

-------------
Designed and milled a bottom plate for stiffening up the X-Y axis.

6 hours.

April 13-14
-------------
Investigated designs for Z-axis. Prototyped a moving-bed
solution based on principle of a cam. Friction was found to
be too high, required precision and rigidity too demanding
to be easily reproducable.
Decided to prototype a moving-bed with 4 axel screws driven by
single step motor and belts next.

10 hours.
