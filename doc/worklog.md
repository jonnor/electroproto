--------------------
Assembled the Makeblock.cc pen plotter kit,
rebuilt to become a more suitable X-Y axis for PCB production.
Did very simple movement and pen-testing to verify all pieces
working.

15 hours.

-------------
Designed and milled a bottom plate for stiffening up the X-Y axis.

6 hours.

April 13-14
-------------
Investigated designs for Z-axis. Prototyped a moving-bed
solution based on principle of a cam. Friction was found to
be too high, required precision and rigidity too demanding
to be easily reproducable.
Decided to prototype a moving-bed with 4 axel screws driven by
single step motor and belts next.

10 hours.

August 7-10, 2014
-------------------
Prototyping moving-bed Z-axis design using 4 leadscrews,
driven by one common belt on a stepper-motor.
Trivial solution hacked together using standard Makeblock parts was non-functional
due instable motor mount, poor belt tension and too high friction in the leadscrews.

Need to create custom motor bracket mount, belt tightener and add bearings to leadscrews.
Also the standard 3d-printed model found for pulley of stepper motor
had too small hole for the locking bolt and needs to be adopted.

Designed & 3d-printed leadscrew bearing mounts.

12 hours.
