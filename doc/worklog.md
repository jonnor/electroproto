--------------------
Assembled the Makeblock.cc pen plotter kit,
rebuilt to become a more suitable X-Y axis for PCB production.
Did very simple movement and pen-testing to verify all pieces
working.

15 hours.

-------------
Designed and milled a bottom plate for stiffening up the X-Y axis.

6 hours.

April 13-14
-------------
Investigated designs for Z-axis. Prototyped a moving-bed
solution based on principle of a cam. Friction was found to
be too high, required precision and rigidity too demanding
to be easily reproducable.
Decided to prototype a moving-bed with 4 axel screws driven by
single step motor and belts next.

10 hours.

August 7-10, 2014
-------------------
Prototyping moving-bed Z-axis design using 4 leadscrews,
driven by one common belt on a stepper-motor.
Using M4 press-fit nut inserts in bed for receiving the leadscrews.

Trivial solution hacked together using standard Makeblock parts was non-functional
due instable motor mount, poor belt tension and too high friction in the leadscrews.

Designed & 3d-printed leadscrew bearing mounts. My first part created in FreeCAD.

After testing with custom motor mount, dound that 28BYJ stepper motor was too weak.
Changed to Makeblock stepper+driver. Uses stock belt pulley, also works better than 3d-printed.

Z-axis now basically functional.
Still needs belt-tightener and fusing the belt to avoid joints too work properly.

16 hours.
